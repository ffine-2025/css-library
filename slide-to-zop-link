For this effect, we have an always-visible underline, but on hover, we’ll grow the underline to the top of the anchor.
Since this underline will slide underneath the text, it’s important to make sure you use colors that will pass a contrast checker to ensure good accessibility.
Since we want the underline to always be visible, note that we changed the default background-size’s width to 100%. To slide the underline to the top of the link, we change the background-size’s height to 100%.
